This PCB is an interface to connect a Gotek to an EPSON PC-286C "PC-Club" using it's internal ribbon cable. 

Umechan's retro ACTIVE (@umechans_retroactive) had already done the reverse engineering in this fantastic video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0FdqVGhqE, 
and I wanted to an excuse to try and design a simple PCB having zero experience. Please feel free to correct all my mistakes.
