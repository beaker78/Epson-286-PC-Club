This PCB is an interface to connect a Gotek to an EPSON PC-286C "PC-Club" using it's internal ribbon cable. 

Umechan's retro ACTIVE (@umechans_retroactive) had already done the reverse engineering in this fantastic video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0FdqVGhqE, 
and I wanted to an excuse to try and design a simple PCB having zero experience. Please feel free to correct all my mistakes.

The FPC FFC flat cable socket to connect the ribbon cable to the PCB should be soldered so it is on the bottom side of the PCB, 
and the floppy header and power connectors should be soldered on the top side of the board. I have attempted to show pin numbers along with the input and output of 
each pin (abbreviated badly) to help with any clarification/diagnosis.
